### Why Did I use IPFS?

I wanted to use IPFS to design a simple and fun app where everyone can collaborate, learn about NFTs and experience them directly.

### How it's made?

NFT gift cards application makes use of the following software:

- Scroll Network: the network we deployed the app for faster and chepear transactions.

- Polybase: giftcard data is stored on Polybase amd we are using IPFS to store the users information, the generated hash (CID) will be used to view the details and to retrieve the NFT.

- ​​ NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency such as distributing rewards and minting the NFT.

* Solidity: Solidity was used for the smart contract together with OpenZeppelin ERC721 for faster development of the smart contract

* hardhat: for local blockchain development

* Frontend: React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

- **MetaMask wallet**: where all the scroll tokens are stored to mint and receive Gift Cards.

## How does it work?

It's a simple process, just come up with a design/idea, start designing, and invite others to sign the Gift card.

Share the NFT Gift Card with that special someone:
Share your awesome idea, design, thoughtful message, or good wishes with your loved ones.

Register your NFT Gift Card
Each NFT Gift Card is represented as an NFT that holds your valuable work and ideas.

Find contributors, family, and friends.
Invite people, family, friends, and even coworkers to sign up for the Gift card. Anyone can see the NFT Gift card, but only members who are invited can access the NFT.

Sell your Designs and get fund it
List your NFT template and offer potential deals for users to buy your design.
